**Project Idea and Goal**

The idea behind this platform is to combine **CARV cryptocurrency price prediction** with a **blockchain-based scoring and ranking mechanism**.

Our goal is to create a transparent, engaging, and competitive environment where users can test their analytical insight into the CARV market and earn points and higher ranks for accurate predictions.

In essence, this project is a **blockchain-based analytical prediction game** that offers users both an educational and competitive experience, while generating valuable behavioral data from the collective analysis of the CARV community.
